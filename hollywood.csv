09/25/2022,Dhar Mann Has Officially Lost His Mind..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrLX6wjY1Ws,32-22,I don't know if you guys have ever seen a channel called Darman a lot of you probably have since his videos get millions of views every single day but for some reason I have only just found out about his channel and honestly my life was so much better before I was aware of this channel if you haven't heard of him before Darman makes videos on a lot of different topics they're mostly acted out as short stories with a moral at the end which doesn't seem like anything revolutionary when you first hear about them but sometimes the videos themselves are absolutely crazy and darches goes way too far to the point that I am literally left speechless Starman is an entrepreneur that set up his YouTube channel back in 2018. when you look at his channel he says in his own words we're not just telling stories we're changing lives I mean that's quite a bold statement to make when all your channel contains are the most random role play scenarios however he also mentions in the description of his channel that he draws from his own experiences with success and failure so already before actually watching any of his videos I had my standards set pretty high but girl I have never had my emotions played with so horribly in all my life pretty much every single one of his videos has the same title it will start with a completely random scenario like mean girl humiliates quiet teen and then almost always the title will finish with what happens next is shocking or and they...
