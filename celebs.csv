11/04/2022,Kendall Jenner.. What is THIS OUTFIT Honey?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4RUV31sOkA,63-15,I'm sorry but why does every Kardashian or Jenner out there try to ruin their memes by profiting off them and reusing them over and over again just let the meme rest and stop milking it for God's sake aside from Kendall receiving tons of hate from her new Halloween costume this week Megan Fox and her boyfriend MGK also received a lot of backlash after they disrespected religion with their outfits and y'all even Landon Barker got accused of copying his enemy little huddy's Halloween costume as well there's a lot to uncover in today's video so without further Ado let's start with Kendall Justin y'all thought that influencers dressing up as controversial people for Halloween was the biggest drama of the year Well Kendall Jenner decided to take the spot with her new decision about her Halloween costume I mean before we get into that specific drama let's just address the issues with the Kardashians and Jenners profiting off of their memes trust me when I say that I don't have any problem with celebrities taking advantage of the attention they're receiving on social media and making a profit off of it but when it comes to a point where these celebs reuse their memes over and over again it sometimes gets pretty annoying and it makes the memes less and less funnier and that is the main problem with the generous nowadays we've seen how Kylie went viral on social media with Horizon shine meme a couple of years ago after this clip from...

10/13/2022,Charli D’amelio Started Singing & People Are NOT Here For It..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxmQrhgskJ0,59-16,yeah I'm actually screaming right now because I never expected people to drag Charlie to milio more than they did to her sister Dixie see this is what happens when you get into the music industry aside from Charlie getting bullied for creating her first ever song surprisingly her sister Dixie also got into some drama after she shared her opinions towards Taylor holder's recent accusations and guys even Lola's ex and Andrew Tate got themselves into a heated argument as well I know this all sounds so unbelievable but let's go ahead and take a look at what went down this week if you guys have seen my previous video then you definitely know about the hate Charlie received after she announced that she will be launching her music career very soon now this situation didn't come from people being jealous and disappointed about Charlie making songs all of a sudden people were just mostly annoyed about how Charlie took this opportunity just to earn money like her sister Dixie of course we addressed in a previous clip how Charlie was very paranoid about Dixie finding out that her sister will be launching her music career just like her and um we all know how that went music is something Charlie's interested in doing I love performing but I don't feel ready to tell Dixie about music just because this was kind of like her thing they're sisters people are gonna compare them I don't know how she'll react to as not telling...
10/10/2022,Hailey Bieber’s skincare ISN’T going well..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr_InUKI6k4,0-20,I think authenticity is extremely important and then just for me personally aesthetic was really important [Music] I stopped using it for a few days didn't notice anything but now I have been barely using it and I've been having to use Aquaphor and Neosporin every day because my lips have been so painfully dry and literally wounded Haley Bieber is no stranger to controversy on the internet aside from the headline she's made after going on the call her daddy podcast last week she is back on the headlines yet again just a week later and this time it's for something way worse than anticipate you all may know that Haley Bieber has been teasing her skincare brand Road skin for what feels like forever now but it seems like ever since she's launched she's been getting hit with pitfalls left and right just over the course of the last few months she has not only reportedly been sued for trademark infringement she's been getting backlashed by the Latina Community for a recent brownie glazed lip product and now people are coming out to speak out about the side effects they've endured since using Haley's products and just to warn you guys it's a lot of people coming forward about some pretty serious skin conditions try the Haley Bieber lip treatment by Road woke up the next morning with severe blistering daily launch rode in June of this year there's even been plenty of well-known influencers calling Hayley out since the start of her launch...
10/07/2022,Monty Lopez Has Officially Lost It...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9SpHFvxKmw,51-26,what is actually going on with Monty Lopez now you guys know there has been an extremely concerning pattern among celebrities and that is that their parents are always terrible obviously not every single person to ever get famous has a horrible mother or father but we consistently see a high frequency of famous people coincidentally having a problematic family member this seems to be even more common when it comes to child stars or people that become famous early on in life and sadly Addison Ray has been the newest victim of having a parent that is absolutely insane Monty Lopez is the father of Addison Ray and for the most part he was just like any other Dad out there in America that was until his daughter became famous since Addison has been starring in lead roles and serving looks at the Met Gala her dad Monty has become more and more cringe each passing day but not only are his actions extremely embarrassing for Addison but they are also probably very upsetting for her too as she would have to have all of her drama including her dad's messy Behavior broadcasted to the world so let's start with the biggest and most shocking Scandal that Monty was involved in which was when 25 year old influencer Renee Ash came out to reveal that she had been in a five month long relationship with Monty all while he was still married to Addison's mother Sherry easterling Monty and Sherry apparently had an often on again marriage however Monty claimed that he was in the process...
07/28/2022,Charli D’amelio EXPOSED For Being RUDE To Fans?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OswVnrMddm8,1-9,can we just take a second and mention how the tik tok community falls apart and goes downhill every freaking july i swear this month is just cursed if you haven't seen the title already apparently charlie d'amalia was exposed earlier this week for being rude to fans as well as josh richards mads lewis and jayden hustler who also got into a heated argument with each other online which ended up horribly without further ado you guys let's take a look at what went down this week it's kind of funny how everyone suddenly switched on charlie to malio as if they weren't supporting her relationship with landon this entire time but i guess people love to mess around and choose who they want to support when goes down because charlie is getting dragged to the fifth for her actions this week i would highly recommend watching my previous video in case you guys want more information on this drama but as most of you guys know chase recently dropped a snippet from his new song that talks about his past relationship with charlie dimelio and how awful it was based on the lyrics we've heard from the snippet after the snippet was dropped charlie immediately unfollowed chase hudson which drew more attention to the whole situation on social media that was until chase went on instagram the next day to reveal that he will be dropping the official song titled all the things i hate ...
08/11/2022,Addison Rae is Losing Her ENTIRE Family..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4_94i9-s4o,23-21,no guys i'm actually losing my mind right now because why the hell is addison's mom hitting on a rapper well her father is embarrassing the entire family right now i genuinely feel bad for their kids this is insane just by the title of today's video you already know that we're going to be talking about addison ray who was humiliated by her entire family this week after so much drama went down between her dad her mom and a rapper and y'all even bryce hall and tana mojo got dragged at some point into this mess as well so without further ado make sure to stay tuned to find out what really happened to be honest this probably seems like some type of entertainment video for y'all but actually it hurts to even speak on this issue considering the fact that addison rey's family is legit falling apart now i don't think it's even suitable for people to address this family and publicly make fun of it but since the rey family decided to bring it online we might as well speak on it and raise awareness for people who struggle with family issues if you haven't seen my previous videos about addison's dad monty then you probably know that he got exposed multiple times for cheating on addison's mom sherry and to make this even worse he even got exposed for being in a five-month relationship with a 20 year old influencer this situation made millions of people terrified especially when monty was getting blasted...
08/09/2022,Do NOT Buy From Kylie Cosmetics Before You See THIS…,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv3PFTqGaI,30-17,i did not just wake up today to kylie jenner pulling a danielle cone on us and breaking lab protocol by wearing no gloves or hair net i mean you know i would sell a clump of hair if i ever find it in my kylie makeup all jokes aside y'all there is a lot of drama going down in the hollywood industry at the moment that i feel like we need to address in today's video because why the hell are people canceling olivia rodrigo for an old drama yeah guys it gets worse than that so make sure to stay tuned to find out what happened this week with kylie jenner olivia rodrigo taylor swift and more you know i always question myself on whether i should make a video dragging kylie jenner for all her scandals because what curse does this woman have to her ability to not get cancelled i mean if you want me to list all the controversies she's been in it would probably take me hours and hours but i guess there's literally no point in that because people will support huge celebrities no matter what happens anyways in my previous video on kylie jenner we addressed how she got canceled by the entire internet after she got exposed for taking three minute flights on her private jet yeah according to multiple headlines that exposed kylie apparently she was causing more co2 emissions than over a thousand average people in one single flight and the fact that many celebrities caused the same risk to the earth is very terrifying and uncontrollable this situation brought so much attention on...
08/06/2022,Addison Rae CANCELED For Mocking Religion?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyKdghvTxEc,29-25,i did not wake up today to addison ray and a clothing brand receiving backlash for mocking and specializing a religion this is way too much for me despite how addison reyes shocked and offended the entire internet this week with her new instagram post charlie dimelio also got into a messy situation on tick tock as well after she got accused of being a bad liar and a homie hopper in her interview you know i've kind of thought about doing a video on addison wright and the horrible situations she's been in on the internet but i thought it would be better if we postponed it due to the controversy that went down between her father and her mother i mean we can all agree that addison and her family had a really rough time a few months ago and i can't really say much about the hate that was floating around on the internet with both addison's parents throwing shade at each other instead of fixing their issues privately this situation made addison and her family receive tons of attention on social media with many media outlets trying to create fake news about the family just to tear them apart however after monty kept adding more fuel to the fire and exposing many of the relationships he had with girls bryce hall decided to step in and involve himself in this messy family situation by defending addison and her mother for being victims in all of this here's what he had to say since dad at the club...
08/03/2022,Jojo Siwa CALLED OUT For Having Internalized Homophobia??,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5o6akBmyYk,25-20,fact that it has been a couple of months since I made a video on Jojo siwa and now she's in multiple dramas is really a lot to take in what happened to you girl we used to be besties if you haven't figured out by the title of this video already yes today we're going to be diving deep into JoJo siwa's recent scandals on the internet and has she managed to beef with a celebrity as well as offend her own sexuality there's a lot to talk about in today's video so without further Ado let's see what Miss siwa has to offer for us this week you know whenever I talk about JoJo siwa on my channel her videos are mostly focused on the Scandal she's been in such as people victimizing her or canceling her for being who she is and aside from that we have also seen videos that address JoJo's dating life and how it caused a major shift in JoJo's personality on the internet ever since she went public with most of her relationships yeah 2021 was a really tough year for Jojo to handle and I'm surprised that she managed to focus on her work more instead of wasting her energy on the internet drama since she's been booked and busy all throughout 2022 with hosting and performing on multiple big shows it just seemed that JoJo was thriving with all the amazing projects she put out this year especially after she let her truth out and changed the internet game forever now of course no one really expected...
07/30/2022,Jojo Siwa DEFENDS Charli D’amelio Over Chase Hudson?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0NTweyfWn4,28-21,okay I don't know what's going on at this point but why the hell is JoJo siwa making fun of Chase Hudson's diss track about Charlie all of a sudden the boredom is really hitting these influencers I swear I don't know why JoJo siwa ended up siding with Charlie Over Chase Hudson but apparently his new song towards Charlie was leaked all over the Internet which caused a huge controversy surrounding Charlie and the horrible things she could have done to chase based on the lyrics he wrote about her in his song we're gonna address all these situations in just a minute so make sure to stay tuned to find out what really went down this week to be honest it was kind of unexpected for Jojo siwa to join the internet this week with a tick tock video dissing Chase Hudson for making a song about Charlie because why on Earth would she get herself involved in a Tick-Tock drama in the first place but I guess the girlies wanted to stick together and support each other during this tough time since both Jojo and Charlie are getting dragged by the entire internet if you have seen my previous videos then you are probably aware of the mess that went down between Chase Charlie and Landon this week and how their managers fans and even clients got involved in it and started spreading fake rumors about each other just to switch the narrative in fact Charlie got Accused at one point of liking a fan edit...
