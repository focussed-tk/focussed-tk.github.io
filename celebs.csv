11/28/2022,This Sick New Trend Needs To STOP ASAP....,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI8_wV7bqSs,69-11,before I go into today's video I want to give a trigger warning because I will be discussing Ed's food restriction weight loss body image and similar topics but with that being said today we will be talking about this extremely sick Trend that we all need to be aware of so that we can protect ourselves better sadly the extreme diet culture is back in full force with this sick Trend making a comeback and we really need to discuss this because the media and many celebs are now actively promoting it I cannot stress enough how bad this is because reducing women's body types to Trends is not just annoying but it can also be extremely dangerous so if you've been on social media especially Tick Tock for the past few months you've probably seen the term heroin sheep and all these people talking about how this 90s aesthetic is back in style now the fact that there is an aesthetic named after a substance issue is bad enough but wait till you see how the mainstream media is pushing this look on young girls and glorifying celebs like Bella Hadid and Kim Kardashian for losing weight what also is very problematic is that some of these celebs who are rumored to be using dangerous medicine and taking Other Extreme Measures to drop weight quickly while at the same time constantly posting photos of themselves eating junk food now I want to point out that this video is not aimed at any celebrity personally but these people are public figures and if they get to enjoy...
11/28/2022,KIM KARDASHIAN IS IN TROUBLE (balenciaga backlash),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUeC4a4I5FQ,0-20,with the holiday season upon us brands are really trying to stand out amongst the competition more and more and that has clearly had some Brands losing sight in right verse wrong and Balenciaga has found themselves in hot water for extremely strange decisions that they've made recently balenciaga's new holiday ad campaign included images of children like literally toddlers holding a teddy bear dressed in a certain attire now the teddy bear was the one that was wearing the interesting clothes that's why it's blurred out but I can't exactly show you guys because I feel like it's inappropriate and I can't show what the teddy bear is wearing but I'll say that it's leather almost sounds like bandages if you know what I mean it's not bandages but it sounds like that word and that's like what they're basically wearing that's what it looks like that type of attire please tell me you know what I'm describing here I mean think ropes and swings that whole vibe yeah that's what the teddy bears were wearing and these kids in the campaign were holding them up not to mentioned that in front of the children you can see the displays of alcoholic products beverages flasks accessories to make drinks and then to top it off and make this even weirder stranger Bears also select photos that were on the Balenciaga website where they were trying to advertise this purse and underneath a purse there are a bunch of these papers and one of these papers actually is a...
11/28/2022,Kim Kardashian SPEAKS OUT On Balenciaga Ad,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx_sA1YqjwM,70-11,over the last week I'm sure you've all heard about the Balenciaga Scandal that's been spreading like wildfire Balenciaga has even reportedly filed a 25 million dollar lawsuit against the production company responsible for an ad campaign that people are going crazy over and rightfully so Balenciaga has shown that they are pro-child to be for their very blatant child predatorial campaign I'm sure you know that Balenciaga is the fashion brand that Kim has heavily been promoting for the last year this is valenciaga's holiday campaign that features two little girls holding bears that are dressed in BDSM wear while would we ever put a child in a photo that contains chains and bondage these are the images they chose to use to promote the sale of millions of dollars and these images actually get far worse this Twitter user exposed that in one of the campaign images right here on valenciaga's website included a very poorly hidden document this photo contains the court document of the United States versus Williams and this was a pretty grotesque Court decision because it pretty much said that Distributing graphic images of children are okay as long as it's not obscene now just to give you guys some context if you aren't up to par with what's been going on with Balenciaga they recently decided to launch a new ad for their holiday campaign but it didn't go the way you think it would people have found a lot of skeptical things about the photos that they shared in...

10/07/2022,Monty Lopez Has Officially Lost It...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9SpHFvxKmw,51-26,what is actually going on with Monty Lopez now you guys know there has been an extremely concerning pattern among celebrities and that is that their parents are always terrible obviously not every single person to ever get famous has a horrible mother or father but we consistently see a high frequency of famous people coincidentally having a problematic family member this seems to be even more common when it comes to child stars or people that become famous early on in life and sadly Addison Ray has been the newest victim of having a parent that is absolutely insane Monty Lopez is the father of Addison Ray and for the most part he was just like any other Dad out there in America that was until his daughter became famous since Addison has been starring in lead roles and serving looks at the Met Gala her dad Monty has become more and more cringe each passing day but not only are his actions extremely embarrassing for Addison but they are also probably very upsetting for her too as she would have to have all of her drama including her dad's messy Behavior broadcasted to the world so let's start with the biggest and most shocking Scandal that Monty was involved in which was when 25 year old influencer Renee Ash came out to reveal that she had been in a five month long relationship with Monty all while he was still married to Addison's mother Sherry easterling Monty and Sherry apparently had an often on again marriage however Monty claimed that he was in the process...
08/11/2022,Addison Rae is Losing Her ENTIRE Family..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4_94i9-s4o,23-21,no guys i'm actually losing my mind right now because why the hell is addison's mom hitting on a rapper well her father is embarrassing the entire family right now i genuinely feel bad for their kids this is insane just by the title of today's video you already know that we're going to be talking about addison ray who was humiliated by her entire family this week after so much drama went down between her dad her mom and a rapper and y'all even bryce hall and tana mojo got dragged at some point into this mess as well so without further ado make sure to stay tuned to find out what really happened to be honest this probably seems like some type of entertainment video for y'all but actually it hurts to even speak on this issue considering the fact that addison rey's family is legit falling apart now i don't think it's even suitable for people to address this family and publicly make fun of it but since the rey family decided to bring it online we might as well speak on it and raise awareness for people who struggle with family issues if you haven't seen my previous videos about addison's dad monty then you probably know that he got exposed multiple times for cheating on addison's mom sherry and to make this even worse he even got exposed for being in a five-month relationship with a 20 year old influencer this situation made millions of people terrified especially when monty was getting blasted...
08/09/2022,Do NOT Buy From Kylie Cosmetics Before You See THIS…,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv3PFTqGaI,30-17,i did not just wake up today to kylie jenner pulling a danielle cone on us and breaking lab protocol by wearing no gloves or hair net i mean you know i would sell a clump of hair if i ever find it in my kylie makeup all jokes aside y'all there is a lot of drama going down in the hollywood industry at the moment that i feel like we need to address in today's video because why the hell are people canceling olivia rodrigo for an old drama yeah guys it gets worse than that so make sure to stay tuned to find out what happened this week with kylie jenner olivia rodrigo taylor swift and more you know i always question myself on whether i should make a video dragging kylie jenner for all her scandals because what curse does this woman have to her ability to not get cancelled i mean if you want me to list all the controversies she's been in it would probably take me hours and hours but i guess there's literally no point in that because people will support huge celebrities no matter what happens anyways in my previous video on kylie jenner we addressed how she got canceled by the entire internet after she got exposed for taking three minute flights on her private jet yeah according to multiple headlines that exposed kylie apparently she was causing more co2 emissions than over a thousand average people in one single flight and the fact that many celebrities caused the same risk to the earth is very terrifying and uncontrollable this situation brought so much attention on...
08/06/2022,Addison Rae CANCELED For Mocking Religion?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyKdghvTxEc,29-25,i did not wake up today to addison ray and a clothing brand receiving backlash for mocking and specializing a religion this is way too much for me despite how addison reyes shocked and offended the entire internet this week with her new instagram post charlie dimelio also got into a messy situation on tick tock as well after she got accused of being a bad liar and a homie hopper in her interview you know i've kind of thought about doing a video on addison wright and the horrible situations she's been in on the internet but i thought it would be better if we postponed it due to the controversy that went down between her father and her mother i mean we can all agree that addison and her family had a really rough time a few months ago and i can't really say much about the hate that was floating around on the internet with both addison's parents throwing shade at each other instead of fixing their issues privately this situation made addison and her family receive tons of attention on social media with many media outlets trying to create fake news about the family just to tear them apart however after monty kept adding more fuel to the fire and exposing many of the relationships he had with girls bryce hall decided to step in and involve himself in this messy family situation by defending addison and her mother for being victims in all of this here's what he had to say since dad at the club...
08/03/2022,Jojo Siwa CALLED OUT For Having Internalized Homophobia??,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5o6akBmyYk,25-20,fact that it has been a couple of months since I made a video on Jojo siwa and now she's in multiple dramas is really a lot to take in what happened to you girl we used to be besties if you haven't figured out by the title of this video already yes today we're going to be diving deep into JoJo siwa's recent scandals on the internet and has she managed to beef with a celebrity as well as offend her own sexuality there's a lot to talk about in today's video so without further Ado let's see what Miss siwa has to offer for us this week you know whenever I talk about JoJo siwa on my channel her videos are mostly focused on the Scandal she's been in such as people victimizing her or canceling her for being who she is and aside from that we have also seen videos that address JoJo's dating life and how it caused a major shift in JoJo's personality on the internet ever since she went public with most of her relationships yeah 2021 was a really tough year for Jojo to handle and I'm surprised that she managed to focus on her work more instead of wasting her energy on the internet drama since she's been booked and busy all throughout 2022 with hosting and performing on multiple big shows it just seemed that JoJo was thriving with all the amazing projects she put out this year especially after she let her truth out and changed the internet game forever now of course no one really expected...
