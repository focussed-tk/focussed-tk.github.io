08/18/2022,Bella Poarch BULLIED By Cardi B After THIS Happened?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7jkTeccJZQ,27-20,who knew the day would come when we'd see both bellaporch and cardi b roasting each other on social media for no reason this must be a fever dream because not gonna lie you guys there's a lot to talk about in today's video because it includes my baby girl bella board who accidentally started a huge mess between nicki minaj and cardi b and y'all she even got dragged for throwing multiple jabs at cardi just to promote her new music i know it's impossible to comprehend that at the moment so with that being said make sure to stick around to find out what really went down you know it's kind of weird to make a drama video on bella porch specifically since she's known for being the most innocent influencer out there and before anyone mentions her past controversies i think the majority of us have moved on from then and i don't think anyone has seen her in any tick tock drama this past year but you might ask yourself what's the reason behind bella's mysterious personality and why isn't she keeping herself relevant like every other tick-tocker well earlier last year we saw bella shifting her entire tick tock career into music after she released her first single bill to be and surprised people with the amount of effort she put into her song other than that she even shocked people with the amazing voice that she has as bella could have so much potential in the future if she keeps pushing now of course bella was already taking her music career seriously aside...
08/12/2022,The Sad Truth About Doja Cat Shaving Her Hair Off..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiWo5mAi8uE,18-16,um 1 re some people out there accusing doja cat of consuming pills just because she shaved her entire head off damn y'all must crave drama so bad aside from doja cat getting dragged this week for shaving her head off unfortunately kim kardashian and pete davidson also announced their breakup which led to kanye west getting involved and y'all even the euphoria actor jacob elordie received tons of hate after he revealed disturbing information about him that shouldn't have been shared on the internet there's a lot to address in today's video so without further ado let's start with doja cat to be honest i feel like none of y'all are actually willing to give doja cat a break and before anyone comes after me i do want to make it clear that i totally understand the hate she received in the past about the noah schnapp situation and i'm aware of the reason why tons of people came after her and called her out for victimizing noah on live but i do want to go back two years before the noah situation went down because as the majority of you guys know doja has been a well-known troll on social media before she became popular i mean we've all seen her do some funny and crazy stuff during her instagram lives which low-key made her get recognized for having a quirky and bubbly personality on social media however as most of her fan base enjoyed this side of doja some people actually hated it and what i mean by this is so many people started...
07/18/2022,Doja Cat CALLED OUT For Bullying A 17 YEAR OLD..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-RgRWuPPg8,33-20,excuse me but how do people go from praising doja cat straight up canceling her twice within a week no something isn't adding up this time before we address the huge drama dosiacat got involved in which included noah schnapp and amber heard we're gonna dive deep into dojicat's life first and how she managed to become a huge star after she had the biggest celebrity cancellation back in 2020 so without further ado you guys let's jump right in you know doja cat is probably one of the most interesting people that i've seen in the hollywood industry and i don't mean this in a shady way i just wonder how she managed to gain the level of success she has at the moment from a meme video that she posted back in 2018. yeah in case you didn't know doja has been doing music ever since she was 18 years old and she was raised by her mother throughout her childhood as her dad was absent most of the time even though there isn't much background on doja's childhood and the environment she lived in she pretty much found herself making and releasing music which made her gain a bit of attention from some of her followers now i do want to make it clear that doja is one of the celebrities who never seeked fame or attention from anyone since she was just minding her own business creating music for her small fan base while trolling online as usual everything changed when she had a career breakthrough back in 2018. after she went on instagram live and decided to write produce and...
