Cooper Noriega,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHPN3tHF-s0,14-21,and all the viewers and fans who loved and supported cooper throughout his lifetime this is what you need to know about cooper who not only got mistreated and misunderstood by the entire world but also gave tons of support to his friends and his fans despite him being at his worst cooper noriega is a well-known tick-tocker who blew up a couple of years ago on the platform after he gained major popularity for his lip-syncing dancing and modeling videos but the difference between cooper and other tick-tockers is that he was also working on his social media accounts before tick tock in fact he is known for making music and releasing them on spotify and he's also a very skilled guitarist so before cooper became successful and switched his career to become a tick-tock influencer he had already completed his early schooling at a local high school in the u.s after that he enrolled himself at a local private university in the united states where he pursued his higher education along with his professional career it was tough for cooper to manage both university and his social media life at the same time and it's still unknown whether cooper actually dropped out of college or not but one thing we can't deny is that since childhood cooper had an interest in dancing and modeling in fact he always wanted to pursue his career as a dancer or a model in the entertainment industry and that's why he found a way to follow his dream career by going on tick tock and posting videos for millions of people to see of course...

08/16/2022,The Pink Sauce Tiktok Scam That EVERYONE Fell For…,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDKxjwaEGJo,13-15,in the last few months tick tock has started up a new feature on the social media platform called tick-tock shop which as the name suggests creates a digital marketplace where vendors can sell their products directly through social media this feature has literally taken tick tock from being a kid's dancing app to basically being a telemarketing company since users can find a product and link it in their video telling all of their followers to buy it which is heavily encouraged through the tick tock app paying these people a small amount of commission if someone buys a product through their link the tick tock shop is probably one of the most polarizing ventures that i have ever seen a social media platform take since you can actually find some amazing deals such as discounted cosmetics and skincare products but then there are also some things that make me really question the thought process of some of the vendors as on the other side of things you can also buy things like an entire rotisserie chicken and extremely cheap energy drinks and in today's video we're going to be talking about one of the most controversial products that has been sold through tick tock it has captured the attention of thousands of people but for all the wrong reasons so without further ado let's take a look into the pink sauce controversy so upon hearing the name above you probably have no idea what the pink sauce could be apart from obviously a sauce that resembles the color of unicorns and...
